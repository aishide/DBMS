**Database Management Systems (DBMS) Lab Summary (2024–25)**

This report summarizes the practical work completed in the Database Management Systems (DBMS) Lab during the academic session 2024–25. The lab focused on fundamental concepts in database design, SQL queries, PL/SQL programming, and database operations through hands-on experiments using relational databases and Oracle tools.

**Practicals Performed**

1. **ER and EER Diagrams and Relational Database Conversion**: Created ER (Entity-Relationship) and EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) diagrams and converted them into relational databases. Designed schema diagrams to represent the structure of the database.

2. **Basic SQL Queries**: Wrote and executed basic SQL queries including `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to manage and manipulate database tables.

3. **SQL Functions**: Developed SQL queries utilizing various built-in functions such as aggregate, numeric, date, string, and conversion functions to perform data manipulation and transformation.

4. **SQL Operators**: Implemented SQL queries using operators such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN` to filter and refine data based on specific conditions.

5. **SQL Subqueries and Joins**: Wrote SQL queries involving subqueries and joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to retrieve and combine data from multiple tables efficiently.

6. **PL/SQL Programs**: Developed simple PL/SQL programs that included conditional statements and loops to handle business logic and automate tasks within the database.

7. **PL/SQL Function for Binary Conversion**: Implemented a PL/SQL function to convert and return the binary equivalent of a decimal number.

8. **PL/SQL Procedure for Fund Transfer**: Created a PL/SQL procedure to simulate a real-world banking scenario where funds are transferred from one account to another with proper validation and error handling.

9. **PL/SQL Triggers**: Wrote and executed triggers using PL/SQL to automatically perform actions such as data validation, auditing, and enforcing business rules upon data modification.

10. **Database Operations using ODBC**: Performed database operations using Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) to interact with databases through a standard interface, allowing cross-platform data exchange.

**Learning Outcomes**

* Gained practical experience in designing databases using ER and EER diagrams and translating them into relational models.
* Developed proficiency in writing and executing SQL queries for data definition, manipulation, and retrieval.
* Acquired skills in PL/SQL programming to automate database operations, handle conditions, and create functions/procedures for complex tasks.
* Learned to implement triggers for maintaining data integrity and automating actions.
* Understood how to connect to databases using ODBC for cross-platform database operations.

**Tools Used**

* Programming Language: SQL, PL/SQL
* Database: Oracle DBMS
* Interface: SQL\*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer
* Connectivity: ODBC

**Conclusion**

The DBMS Lab provided essential hands-on experience with database design, SQL query formulation, and PL/SQL programming. The practical exercises helped bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world database management applications, laying a solid foundation for database system development and administration.
